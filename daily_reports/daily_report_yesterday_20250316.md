<div><p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Social network Bluesky recently <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/proposals/tree/main/0008-user-intents">published a proposal on GitHub</a> outlining new options it could give users to indicate whether they want their posts and data to be scraped for things like generative AI training and public archiving.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">CEO Jay Graber <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/10/bluesky-is-weighing-a-proposal-that-gives-users-consent-over-how-their-data-is-used-for-ai/">discussed the proposal earlier this week,</a> while on-stage at South by Southwest, but it attracted fresh attention on Friday night, after she <a rel="nofollow" href="https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team/post/3lkens3n4w223">posted about it on Bluesky</a>. Some users reacted with alarm to the company&#8217;s plans, which they saw as a reversal of Bluesky&#8217;s previous insistence that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/03/what-is-bluesky-everything-to-know-about-the-x-competitor/">won&#8217;t sell user data to advertisers</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/15/unlike-x-bluesky-says-it-wont-train-ai-on-your-posts/">won&#8217;t train AI on user posts</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;Oh, hell no!&#8221; the user Sketchette <a rel="nofollow" href="https://bsky.app/profile/sketchette.bsky.social/post/3lkeoa2k2sc2n">wrote</a>. &#8220;The beauty of this platform was the NOT sharing of information. Especially gen AI. Don&#8217;t you cave now.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Graber <a rel="nofollow" href="https://bsky.app/profile/jay.bsky.team/post/3lkeojfh3u223">replied</a> that generative AI companies are &#8220;already scraping public data from across the web,&#8221; including from Bluesky, since &#8220;everything on Bluesky is public like a website is public.&#8221; So she said Bluesky is trying to create a &#8220;new standard&#8221; to govern that scraping, similar to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt">robots.txt</a> file that websites use to communicate their permissions to web crawlers.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Debates about AI training and copyright have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/02/news-outlets-are-accusing-perplexity-of-plagiarism-and-unethical-web-scraping/">dragged robots.txt into the spotlight</a>, among other things highlighting the fact that it&#8217;s not legally enforceable. Bluesky frames its proposed standard as one that would have a similar &#8220;mechanism and expectations,&#8221; providing &#8220;a machine-readable format, which good actors are expected to abide, and does carry ethical weight, but is not legally enforceable.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Under the proposal, users of the Bluesky app, or other apps that use the underlying <a rel="nofollow" href="https://atproto.com/">ATProtocol</a>, could go into their settings and allow or disallow the usage of their Bluesky data across four categories: generative AI, protocol bridging (i.e., connecting different social ecosystems), bulk datasets, and web archiving (such as the Internet Archive&#8217;s Wayback Machine).</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">If a user indicates that they don&#8217;t want their data used to train generative AI, the proposal says, &#8220;Companies and research teams building AI training sets are expected to respect this intent when they see it, either when scraping websites, or doing bulk transfers using the protocol itself.&#8221;</p>
<p class="marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience">
</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Molly White, who writes the Citation Needed newsletter and Web3 is Going Just Great blog, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://bsky.app/profile/molly.wiki/post/3lkg6zdex6s2t">described this</a> as &#8220;a good proposal,&#8221; and said it was &#8220;weird to see people flaming BlueSky for it,&#8221; since it&#8217;s not so much &#8220;welcoming in AI scraping&#8221; but rather &#8220;trying to add a consent signal to allow users to communicate preferences for the scraping that is already happening.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;I think the weakness with this and [Creative Commons&#8217;] similar proposal for &#8216;preference signals&#8217; is that they rely on scrapers to respect these signals out of some desire to be good actors,&#8221; White continued. &#8220;We&#8217;ve already seen some of these companies blow right past robots.txt or pirate material to scrape.&#8221;</p>

<div><p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">SpaceX successfully launched four people into space on Friday, beginning a mission that will give the International Space Station enough crew members to allow astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore to return to Earth after their nine-month stay.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The mission, known as Crew-10, will see SpaceX&#8217;s Dragon spacecraft dock with the International Space Station (ISS) late Saturday. The new astronauts will overlap with the existing crew for a few days before Williams and Wilmore (along with two others) return to our planet. That could happen as soon as March 19, weather permitting.</p>

<p class="ad-unit__ad" id="us-tc-ros-mw-mid-center">

<p class="ad-unit__ad" id="us-tc-ros-dt-native-midarticle">
	</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">SpaceX crew launches to the ISS have become routine, but this mission has been hotly anticipated because of how Williams and Wilmore got to the station in the first place &#8212; and because SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has blamed their prolonged stay on former President Joe Biden.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The duo was part of the first crewed launch of Boeing&#8217;s Starliner spacecraft last June. The test mission was supposed to be a crucial milestone in Boeing&#8217;s quest to compete with SpaceX for these types of crewed launches to the ISS. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Starliner was supposed to dock with the ISS for 10 days before returning Williams and Wilmore to Earth. But the spacecraft experienced leaks and thruster problems, which delayed Starliner from docking with the ISS. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Starliner eventually coupled with the station and the astronauts were able to board. But Boeing and NASA spent weeks performing testing and analysis before they <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/24/starliner-will-return-to-earth-uncrewed-astronauts-staying-on-iss-until-february/">decided in August</a> to bring Starliner back to Earth empty. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">NASA and SpaceX agreed to bring the astronauts home on the next crewed mission to the ISS, Crew-9. They bumped two astronauts off that flight to accommodate the return of Williams and Wilmore. A return flight was slated for February 2025; an earlier flight would have left the ISS understaffed, according to NASA.</p>
<p class="marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience">
</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">While Williams and Wilmore have been aboard the ISS, though, Musk helped Donald Trump get elected for a second time and launched his <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/12/the-people-in-elon-musk-doge-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Government Efficiency</a>. Musk started saying &#8212; both on X and in interviews &#8212; that he <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/Acyn/status/1892036911969321283">offered to bring the astronauts back</a> earlier but that Biden refused because of political reasons.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Musk has not provided any evidence to support this claim. NASA&#8217;s former administrator and deputy administrator under Biden have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/03/04/starliner-astronauts-musk-spacex-nasa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">both</a> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-24/ex-nasa-leader-never-heard-musk-offer-of-early-astronaut-return?srnd=undefined&amp;embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a> that no offer from Musk made it to the space agency&#8217;s headquarters. </p>

Microsoft, the parent company, confirmed that the official sunset date for the service is May 5, 2025.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Skype users can either migrate all their contacts and chat data to Microsoft Teams, or they can choose to download their Skype data and transition to another video-calling service.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">To assist users in the switch, we&#8217;ve created a guide on how to migrate to Teams or download Skype data. Additionally, we&#8217;ve curated a list of alternative video-calling apps that can replace Skype.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-move-from-skype-to-microsoft-teams">How to move from Skype to Microsoft Teams</h2>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Before May 5, Skype users can sign in to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/log-in" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Teams</a> for free using their Skype credentials. Once logged in, all their chats and contacts will automatically transfer to the app.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Teams offers features similar to Skype, including one-on-one and group calls, messaging, and file sharing. While Skype was primarily designed for smaller groups (up to 20 participants) and casual use, Teams is more business-focused, accommodating up to 10,000 participants in a single video call. It also comes with advanced security features and various integrations, such as Evernote, OneDrive, Office 365, Salesforce, SharePoint, Trello, and more.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Teams is available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.teams&amp;hl=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Android</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-teams/id1113153706" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">iOS</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mac</a>, PC, and the web.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">For users who aren&#8217;t interested in making the transition to Microsoft Teams, we still recommend exporting account data. This ensures that valuable information &#8212; such as messages, files, and contact details &#8212; is backed up and can be accessed in the future.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-here-are-the-best-skype-alternatives">Here are the best Skype alternatives</h2>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-google-meet">Google Meet</h3>

<img width="1422" height="800" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/google-meet-pause-tiles.jpg?w=680" alt="google meet screen" class="wp-image-2531844"><p class="wp-block-image__credits"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">An obvious benefit of using <a href="https://meet.google.com/landing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Google Meet</a> is that it&#8217;s available for free with a Google account. Since a lot of people are already using Google and have existing accounts, transitioning to this platform would be fairly easy.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Google Meet allows users to hold meetings with up to 100 participants, record meetings, share screens, and more. A drawback with the free plan is that if a meeting has more than three participants, there&#8217;s a 60-minute time limit.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Large companies may want to purchase a Google Workspace plan for features like having up to 25 co-hosts, dividing participants into smaller breakout rooms during meetings, creating polls, setting up a Q&amp;A session, livestreaming to YouTube, and more. Workspace &#8212; which has plans for $7/month, $14/month, $22/month, and up &#8212; also offers AI-powered tools through its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/26/what-is-google-gemini-ai/">Gemini assistant</a>, which helps Meet users take notes and create custom background images.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-zoom">Zoom</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><a href="https://zoom.us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Zoom </a>is another popular web-conferencing tool. It offers several helpful features, including the ability to host up to 100 participants and chat in both private and public groups, and has tools such as notes, a whiteboard, and screen-sharing capabilities. Users can also record meetings and access transcripts.&#160;</p>

<p class="ad-unit__ad" id="us-tc-ros-mw-mid-center">
	</p>
<p class="ad-unit__ad" id="us-tc-ros-dt-native-midarticle">
	</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">However, one downside is the 40-minute time limit per meeting for users on the free plan. To avoid having meetings cut off, users will need to purchase a subscription, which ranges from $13/month to $18/month. Paid subscribers have access to Zoom&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/05/zoom-rebrands-existing-and-intros-new-generative-ai-features/">AI Companion</a>, which includes the ability to summarize meetings and ask questions about transcribed meetings.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-webex">Webex</h3>

<img width="800" height="450" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/webex-videocall.jpeg?w=680" alt="" class="wp-image-2978140"><p class="wp-block-image__credits"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Webex</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><a href="https://www.webex.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Webex</a>, the Cisco-owned video conferencing tool, offers a similar plan to its competitors. For instance, it has features such as screen sharing, the ability to record sessions, a whiteboard capability, and more.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The free plan includes up to 100 attendees per meeting, as well as an unfortunate 40-minute time limit. Webex also offers plans from $12/month, $22/month, and up, depending on team size. The paid tiers come with an AI assistant, live polling, Q&amp;A, and the ability to add up to 1,000 attendees.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-discord">Discord</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><a href="https://discord.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord</a> was initially designed as a chat platform for gamers, but it can also serve as an alternative to Skype for personal use or for smaller teams. However, it&#8217;s not recommended for larger businesses, as it limits calls to 25 participants.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">On the positive side, Discord offers unlimited meeting lengths and features such as screen sharing, the ability to record meetings, and breakout rooms. The platform has a free plan in addition to two paid options priced at $5/month and $10/month, making it one of the more affordable choices available, depending on users&#8217; needs.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-slack">Slack</h3>

<img width="700" height="700" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/slack-huddles.jpg?w=680" alt="" class="wp-image-2978131"><p class="wp-block-image__credits"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Slack</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">While <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Slack</a> may not be ideal for formally scheduled meetings with large groups, it can be effective for spontaneous meetings within team chats. The Huddle feature in Slack enables users to easily transition from a chat thread to an informal audio or video call with colleagues. On the free plan, Huddles can accommodate only two people, whereas paid plans (priced at $7/month or $12/month) allow for up to 50.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-signal">Signal</h3>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><a href="https://signal.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Signal</a>, the encrypted messaging app, has provided <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/12/signal-gets-new-video-call-features-making-it-a-viable-alternative-to-zoom-meet-and-teams/">group video-calling features</a> since <a href="https://signal.org/blog/group-calls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2020</a> and can accommodate up to 50 participants in a single call.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Although it&#8217;s not a direct competitor to Skype, it allows users to share links for calls, enabling them to simply send the link to others rather than creating a group, much like Google Meet, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams do. Notably, Signal is free to use.</p>

<div><p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">On Thursday, House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-OH) <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/media/press-releases/chairman-jordan-seeks-documents-about-biden-harris-censorship-pressure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sent letters to 16 American technology firms</a>, including Google and OpenAI, asking for past communications with the&#160;Biden administration that might suggest the former president &#8220;coerced or colluded&#8221; with companies to &#8220;censor lawful speech&#8221; in AI products.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The Trump administration&#8217;s top technology advisors previously signaled they would pick a fight with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/15/trumps-silicon-valley-advisers-have-ai-censorship-in-their-crosshairs/">Big Tech over &#8220;AI censorship</a>,&#8221; which is seemingly the next phase in the culture war between conservatives and Silicon Valley. Jordan previously led an investigation into whether the Biden administration and Big Tech <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/media/in-the-news/jordan-demands-big-tech-records-detailing-collusion-with-biden-admin-to-censor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">colluded to silence conservative voices on</a> social media platforms. Now, he&#8217;s turning his attention to AI companies &#8212; and their intermediaries.</p>

<p class="ad-unit__ad" id="us-tc-ros-mw-mid-center">
	</p>
<p class="ad-unit__ad" id="us-tc-ros-dt-native-midarticle">
	</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In letters to technology executives including Google CEO Sundar Pichai, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and Apple CEO Tim Cook, Jordan pointed to a <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/12.18.24%20Censorships%20Next%20Frontier%20The%20Federal%20Governments%20Attempt%20to%20Control%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20to%20Suppress%20Free%20Speech.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a> his committee published in December that he claims &#8220;uncovered the Biden-Harris Administration&#8217;s efforts to control AI to suppress speech.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">In this latest inquiry, Jordan asked Adobe, Alphabet, Amazon, Anthropic, Apple, Cohere, IBM, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, OpenAI,&#160;Palantir, Salesforce, Scale AI, and&#160;Stability AI for information. They have until March 27 to provide it.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">TechCrunch reached out to the companies for comment. Most didn&#8217;t immediately respond. Nvidia, Microsoft, and Stability AI declined to comment.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">There&#8217;s one notable omission in Jordan&#8217;s list: billionaire Elon Musk&#8217;s frontier AI lab, xAI. That may be because Musk, a close Trump ally, is a tech leader who has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/15/trumps-silicon-valley-advisers-have-ai-censorship-in-their-crosshairs/">at the forefront of conversations about AI censorship</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The writing was on the wall that conservative lawmakers would ramp up scrutiny over alleged AI censorship. Perhaps in anticipation of an investigation such as Jordan&#8217;s, several tech companies have changed the ways their AI chatbots handle politically sensitive queries.</p>
<p class="marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience">
</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Earlier this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/16/openai-tries-to-uncensor-chatgpt/">OpenAI announced it was changing the way it trains AI models</a> to represent more perspectives and ensure ChatGPT wasn&#8217;t censoring certain viewpoints. OpenAI denies this was an attempt to appease the Trump administration, but rather an effort to double down on the company&#8217;s core values.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Anthropic, for its part, has said that its newest AI model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, will refuse to answer fewer questions and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/24/anthropic-launches-a-new-ai-model-that-thinks-as-long-as-you-want/">give more nuanced responses on controversial subjects.</a></p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Other companies have been slower to change how their AI models treat political subject matter. Leading up to the 2024 U.S. election, Google said that its Gemini chatbot wouldn&#8217;t respond to political queries. Even well after the election, TechCrunch found that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/04/google-still-limits-how-gemini-answers-political-questions/">the chatbot wouldn&#8217;t consistently answer even simple questions related to politics</a>, like &#8220;Who is the current President?&#8221;</p>

<p class="ad-unit__ad" id="us-tc-ros-dt-native-midarticle">
	</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Some tech execs, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, have added fuel to conservative accusations of Silicon Valley censorship by claiming the Biden administration pressured social media companies to <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/zuckerberg-says-the-white-house-pressured-facebook-to-censor-some-covid-19-content-during-the-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">suppress certain content like COVID-19 misinformation</a>.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">But some Bench customers say they&#8217;re being charged to get books or tax returns they previously paid for.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25560816-complaint-ba79d3ab-async/?mode=document#document/p8">A lawsuit</a> filed on Tuesday by Bench customer Qorum claims that Bench required it to pay to get its 2023 tax return, despite having already paid for the service under Bench&#8217;s previous owners.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;Defendant Jesse Tinsley made negligent misrepresentations when he falsely stated that Employer.com would honor prepaid Bench services,&#8221; the lawsuit alleges.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Another customer, who requested anonymity, was shocked to learn they needed to renew their subscription to get accounting books completed when they paid for that service two years ago, according to correspondence seen by TechCrunch.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">When they questioned this, a Bench representative told them that &#8220;Bench 2.0&#8221; has no affiliation with prior obligations and that Employer.com couldn&#8217;t take on unpaid work.</p>
<p class="marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience">
</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Employer.com&#8217;s CMO Matt Charney strongly disputes that Bench is charging for previously paid work. &#8220;We have been, and are honoring pre-paid services for our customers,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Charney also said it delivered that tax 2023 return to Qorum without requiring additional payment. But Qorum&#8217;s founder Andrew Pietra told TechCrunch he was required to continue his subscription to get the return in the first place.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Under its previous ownership, Bench burned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/05/bench-burned-through-135-million-before-shutting-down/">through $135 million</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/03/inside-the-wild-fall-and-last-minute-revival-of-bench-the-vc-backed-accounting-startup-that-imploded-over-the-holidays/">struggled to get AI </a>to replace human bookkeepers.

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Many books and returns remained incomplete when Bench abruptly shut down on December 26 last year. Employer.com, a U.S. company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/30/bench-to-be-acquired-after-abruptly-shutting-down/">announced plans</a> to buy the Canadian fintech less than 72 hours later.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Employer.com bought Bench for $9 million, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25561741-ksv-bench-filing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">bankruptcy filings</a> submitted in Canada show.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The fintech&#8217;s abrupt collapse was caused by a lack of liquidity after its main creditor, the National Bank of Canada, declined to lend it an additional $7.7 million in December 2024. The NBC had already provided $51 million USD in credit to the troubled startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/16/failed-fintech-startup-bench-racked-up-over-65-million-in-debt-documents-reveal/">according to previous filings.</a></p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Ironically, it&#8217;s the news of Bench&#8217;s sudden shutdown that led to its rescue.

<div><p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">As businesses race to replace humans with AI &#8220;agents,&#8221; coding assistant Cursor may have given us a peek at the attitude bots could bring to work, too.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Cursor reportedly told a user going by the name &#8220;janswist&#8221; that he should write the code himself instead of relying on Cursor to do it for him.</p>

<p class="ad-unit__ad" id="us-tc-ros-mw-mid-center">
	</p>
<p class="ad-unit__ad" id="us-tc-ros-dt-native-midarticle">
	</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;I cannot generate code for you, as that would be completing your work &#8230; you should develop the logic yourself. This ensures you understand the system and can maintain it properly,&#8221; janswist said Cursor told him after he spent an hour &#8220;vibe&#8221; coding with the tool.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">So janswist filed <a href="https://forum.cursor.com/t/cursor-told-me-i-should-learn-coding-instead-of-asking-it-to-generate-it-limit-of-800-locs/61132" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a bug report</a> on the company&#8217;s product forum: &#8220;Cursor told me I should learn coding instead of asking it to generate it,&#8221; and included a screen shot. The bug report soon went viral on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43351137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hacker News,</a> and was covered by<a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/ai-coding-assistant-refuses-to-write-code-tells-user-to-learn-programming-instead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> Ars Technica.</a></p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Janswist speculated that he hit some kind of hard limit at 750-800 lines of code, although other users replied that Cursor will write more code than that for them. One commenter suggested that janswist should have used Cursor&#8217;s&#160;&#8220;agent&#8221; integration, which works for bigger coding projects. Anysphere, maker of Cursor, couldn&#8217;t be reached for comment.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">But Cursor&#8217;s refusal also sounded an awful lot like the replies newbie coders could get when asking questions on programming forum Stack Overflow, folks on Hacker News pointed out.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The suggestion is that if Cursor trained on that site it may have learned not just coding tips, but human snark as well.<br></p>

<div><p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Swedish fintech Klarna took the next step in its highly anticipated U.S. IPO on Friday when it made its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2003292/000162828025012824/klarnagroupplcf-1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">F-1</a> prospectus public. We are sifting through the document now.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Klarna hopes to raise at least $1 billion at a $15 billion valuation with this IPO, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-06/klarna-set-to-file-for-1-billion-plus-ipo-as-soon-as-next-week" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg reported last week.</a> The public documents don&#8217;t yet reveal how many shares it plans to sell or the price range, so we won&#8217;t know if this IPO will meet its fundraising aspirations or not until it prices shares. That&#8217;s typically around a month, sometimes more, after the prospectus documents are made public for everyone to chew on.</p>

<p class="ad-unit__ad" id="us-tc-ros-dt-native-midarticle">
	</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">However, this IPO has been anticipated for years now so perhaps its bankers have some indication that investors will bite at that level. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">One reason could be that Klarna&#8217;s previous private valuation recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-28/klarna-valuation-raised-by-chrysalis-as-fintech-preps-for-ipo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">rebounded&#160;to $14.6 billion</a>, according to reports, after one investor increased its stake. <br><br>Another could be that Klarna is reporting a profit. Specifically, Klarna reported revenue of $2.8 billion for 2024, up from around $2.3 billion in 2023. It also reported a net profit of $21 million in 2024, a big swing from a loss in 2023 of -$244 million.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Founded in 2005 by its current CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Klarna is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/03/affirm-launches-in-the-uk-as-buy-now-pay-later-market-faces-regulatory-overhaul/">one of several players</a> that offer&#160;buy now, pay later financing to customers for purchases. After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/28/klarna-a-unicorn-is-coming-to-the-u-s-and-going-after-u-s-credit-card-companies/">launching in the U.S.</a> in 2015, Klarna hit a hefty valuation of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/fintech-giant-klarna-raises-639m-at-a-45-6b-valuation/">more than $45 billion</a> by 2021, a figure that swiftly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/11/klarna-confirms-800m-raise-as-valuation-drops-85-to-6-7b/">plummeted by 85% to $6.5 billion</a> when the 2021 venture capital valuation bubble burst.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Klarna has recently been making news for developing its own in-house AI system based on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/12/chatgpt-everything-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot/">OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT</a> and saying that it dropped its contract for Salesforce CRM to use its internal systems instead.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Siemiatkowski said its homegrown ChatGPT-powered customer service bot <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-28/teleperformance-sinks-as-klarna-fuels-worries-over-impact-of-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">led to replacing 700 full-time contract</a> employees and a savings of approximately $40 million annually. He even went so far as to say that Klarna stopped hiring aggressively because of its use of AI, letting its <a href="https://x.com/klarnaseb/status/1888718931017290052" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">workforce dwindle </a>from 5,000 in 2023 to about 3,500 by the end of 2024.</p>

<div><p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">Google will replace Google Assistant on Android phones with Gemini later this year, the company announced on Friday. </p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-assistant-gemini-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said in a blog post</a> that it&#8217;ll upgrade more users from Google Assistant to Gemini &#8220;over the coming months.&#8221; Later this year, Assistant will no longer be accessible on most mobile devices or available from app stores.</p>

<p class="ad-unit__ad" id="us-tc-ros-dt-native-midarticle">

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;Additionally, we&#8217;ll be upgrading tablets, cars and devices that connect to your phone, such as headphones and watches, to Gemini,&#8221; the company added. &#8220;We&#8217;re also bringing a new experience, powered by Gemini, to home devices like speakers, displays and TVs.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Google said it&#8217;ll share more details with users in the next few months, and that, until then, Assistant will continue to operate on the aforementioned devices.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Google notes it has worked to improve the Gemini user experience ahead of the Assistant wind-down, especially for users relying on various Assistant functions. For instance, Google has added several highly requested features to Gemini on Android devices, such as the ability to play music, support for timers, and an option to take actions directly from a user&#8217;s lock screen.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The move to drop Assistant in favor of Gemini isn&#8217;t surprising, especially considering Google launched its Pixel 9 smartphone line&#160;with Gemini as the default virtual assistant. Google notes that Gemini has more advanced capabilities than Assistant (in theory, at least), and provides new ways of getting help and info on topics via tools like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/13/gemini-live-googles-answer-to-chatgpts-advanced-voice-mode-launches/">Gemini Live</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/11/gemini-can-now-research-deeper/">Deep Research</a>.</p>

<div><p id="speakable-summary" class="wp-block-paragraph">This week, Google released a family of open AI models, Gemma 3, that quickly garnered praise for their impressive efficiency. But as a <a href="https://x.com/xlr8harder/status/1899892937581887540" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">number</a> <a href="https://x.com/natolambert/status/1900035873963680233" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">of</a> <a href="https://x.com/HanchungLee/status/1899899117004091484" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">developers</a> lamented on X, Gemma 3&#8217;s license makes commercial use of the models a risky proposition.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">It&#8217;s not a problem unique to Gemma 3. Companies like Meta also apply custom, non-standard licensing terms to their openly available models, and the terms present legal challenges for companies. Some firms, especially smaller operations, worry that Google and others could &#8220;pull the rug&#8221; on their business by asserting the more onerous clauses.</p>

<p class="ad-unit__ad" id="us-tc-ros-mw-mid-center">

<p class="ad-unit__ad" id="us-tc-ros-dt-native-midarticle">
	</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;The restrictive and inconsistent licensing of so-called &#8216;open&#8217; AI models is creating significant uncertainty, particularly for commercial adoption,&#8221; Nick Vidal, head of community at the Open Source Initiative, a&#160;<a href="https://opensource.org/history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">long-running institution</a>&#160;aiming to define and &#8220;steward&#8221; all things open source, told TechCrunch. &#8220;While these models are marketed as open, the actual terms impose various legal and practical hurdles that deter businesses from integrating them into their products or services.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Open model developers have their reasons for releasing models under proprietary licenses as opposed to industry-standard options like <a href="https://soos.io/apache-vs-mit-license" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Apache and MIT</a>. AI startup Cohere, for example, <a href="https://docs.cohere.com/v2/docs/cohere-faqs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has been clear</a> about its intent to support scientific &#8212; but not commercial &#8212; work on top of its models.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">But Gemma and Meta&#8217;s Llama&#160;licenses&#160;in particular have restrictions&#160;that limit the ways companies can use the models without fear of legal reprisal.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Meta, for instance, <a href="https://www.llama.com/llama3/license/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">prohibits developers</a> from using the &#8220;output or results&#8221; of Llama 3 models to improve any model besides Llama 3 or &#8220;derivative works.&#8221; It also prevents companies with over 700 million monthly active users from deploying Llama models without first obtaining a special, additional license.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"><a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemma/terms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gemma&#8217;s license</a> is generally less burdensome. But it does grant Google the right to &#8220;restrict (remotely or otherwise) usage&#8221; of Gemma that Google believes is in violation of the company&#8217;s <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemma/prohibited_use_policy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">prohibited use policy</a> or &#8220;applicable laws and regulations.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p class="marfeel-experience-inline-cta wp-block-tc23-marfeel-experience">
</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">These terms don&#8217;t just apply to the original Llama and Gemma models. Models based on Llama or Gemma must also adhere to the Llama and Gemma licenses, respectively. In Gemma&#8217;s case, that includes models trained on synthetic data generated by Gemma.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Florian Brand, a research assistant at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence, believes that &#8212; despite <a href="https://x.com/JeffDean/status/1899933506400108599" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">what tech giant execs would have you believe</a> &#8212; licenses like Gemma and Llama&#8217;s &#8220;cannot reasonably be called &#8216;open source.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;Most companies have a set of approved licenses, such as Apache 2.0, so any custom&#160;license&#160;is a lot of trouble and money,&#8221; Brand told TechCrunch. &#8220;Small companies without legal teams or money for lawyers will stick to models with standard licenses.&#8221; </p>

<p class="ad-unit__ad" id="us-tc-ros-mw-mid-center">
	</p>
<p class="ad-unit__ad" id="us-tc-ros-dt-native-midarticle">
	</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Brand noted that AI model developers with custom licenses, like Google, haven&#8217;t aggressively enforced their terms yet. However, the threat is often enough to deter adoption, he added.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;These restrictions have an impact on the AI ecosystem &#8212; even on AI researchers like me,&#8221; said Brand.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Han-Chung Lee, director of machine learning at Moody&#8217;s, agrees that custom licenses such as those attached to Gemma and Llama make the models &#8220;not usable&#8221; in many commercial scenarios. So does Eric Tramel, a staff applied scientist at AI startup Gretel.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;Model-specific licenses make specific carve-outs for model derivatives and distillation, which causes concern about clawbacks,&#8221; Tramel said. &#8220;Imagine a business that is specifically producing model fine-tunes for their customers. What&#160;license&#160;should a Gemma-data fine-tune of Llama have?  What would the impact be for all of&#160;their&#160;downstream customers?&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The scenario that deployers most fear, Tramel said, is that the models are a trojan horse of sorts.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph"> &#8220;A model foundry can put out [open] models, wait to see what business cases develop using those models, and then strong-arm their way into successful verticals by either extortion or lawfare,&#8221; he said. &#8220;For example, Gemma 3, by all appearances, seems like a solid release &#8212; and one that could have a broad impact. But the market can&#8217;t adopt it because of its&#160;license&#160;structure. So, businesses will likely stick with perhaps weaker and less reliable Apache 2.0 models.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">To be clear, certain models have achieved widespread distribution in spite of their restrictive licenses. Llama, for example, has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/06/meta-unveils-a-new-more-efficient-llama-model/">downloaded hundreds of millions of times</a> and built into products from major corporations, including Spotify.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">But they could be even more successful if they were permissively licensed, according to Yacine Jernite, head of machine learning and society at AI startup Hugging Face. Jernite called on providers like Google to move to open license frameworks and &#8220;collaborate more directly&#8221; with users on broadly accepted terms.</p>

<p class="ad-unit__ad" id="us-tc-ros-mw-mid-center">
	</p>
<p class="ad-unit__ad" id="us-tc-ros-dt-native-midarticle">
	</p>
<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;Given the lack of consensus on these terms and the fact that many of the underlying assumptions haven&#8217;t yet been tested in courts, it all serves primarily as a declaration of intent from those actors,&#8221; Jernite said. &#8220;[But if certain clauses] are interpreted too broadly, a lot of good work will find itself on uncertain legal ground, which is particularly scary for organizations building successful commercial products.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Vidal said that there&#8217;s an urgent need for AI models companies that can freely integrate, modify, and share without fearing sudden&#160;license&#160;changes or legal ambiguity.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">&#8220;The current landscape of AI model licensing is riddled with confusion, restrictive terms, and misleading claims of openness,&#8221; Vidal said. &#8220;Instead of redefining &#8216;open&#8217; to suit corporate interests, the AI industry should align with established open source principles to create a truly open ecosystem.&#8221;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">For regular readers of TechCrunch Mobility, you may be wondering, &#8220;Why did this newsletter land in my inbox on Friday?&#8221; Folks, we&#8217;re moving days in an effort to bring you a more complete rundown of the news of the week.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">I spent the last week at SXSW, the annual tech, film, comedy, and music festival in Austin. I recommend <a href="https://techcrunch.com/storyline/sxsw-2025-live-coverage-health-tips-from-bryan-johnson-concerns-about-elon-musk-and-what-its-like-to-actually-ride-a-waymo-uber-on-the-conferences-final-day/page/1/">scrolling through our live blog</a> to catch up on all the transportation, AI, social media, creator economy &#8212; basically tech &#8212; news that happened during the conference.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">I&#8217;ve watched Austin evolve over the years with some good and bad outcomes. Protected bike lanes have been one positive development, which I appreciated as I rode a few Lime scooters and two Mod Bikes e-bikes around the city. Austin is also becoming a hub for autonomous vehicle activity with Avride headquartered there, Zoox testing on public roads, and Waymo launching a commercial robotaxi service.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">I was lucky enough to be matched with two Waymo robotaxis &#8212; all ride-hails occur through the Uber app, so it&#8217;s never a guarantee. I also had one coordinated match courtesy of Waymo. As I wrote earlier this week, it is absolutely wild that Waymo and Uber are working together. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/snippet/2978612/waymo-v-uber-lets-all-take-a-trip-down-memory-lane/">Here&#8217;s why</a>.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Oh, and here is what I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/snippet/2980430/what-we-discovered-when-we-finally-matched-with-a-waymo-robotaxi/">discovered in my Waymo-Uber robotaxi ride</a>. Hint: some updates to the user interface.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">Senior reporter Sean O&#8217;Kane took a deep dive into a new venture firm called <strong>Leitmotif </strong>that&#8217;s been quietly making loads of deals for the past 16 months. The firm, which has funded around 20 startups, broadly focuses on decarbonization with a portfolio that includes EV companies, space and battery plays, and four nuclear fusion startups.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">That&#8217;s not the interesting part. Here&#8217;s what is: All of the money in its fund came from the Volkswagen Group. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/11/meet-the-new-vc-firm-secretly-backed-by-volkswagen/">Check out the full story</a> about why the German automotive giant has committed $300 million to Leitmotif&#8217;s first fund.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">This week I tried two e-bikes from Austin-based <strong>Mod Bikes</strong>. I&#8217;ll focus on its newest one, the <strong>Groove</strong>, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/snippet/2978365/mod-bikes-launched-its-new-groove-e-bike/">launched earlier this week</a>.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">I spent 24 hours with the <strong>Groove</strong>, an all-electric step-through bike with a souped-up beach cruiser look and feel. The Groove existed before, but Mod Bikes discontinued it. Now it&#8217;s back and has been updated throughout, including the frame, battery, torque sensor, smart display, and motor.</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The bike itself is sporty and polished with lots of thoughtful details that make the <a href="https://mod-bikes.com/products/mod-groove-step-thru-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">$1,999 price</a> seem like a steal. The design is thoughtful with easy-to-read and easy-to-operate controls and an integrated bike lock that folds neatly on the frame.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">The Groove is a throttle and pedal assist bike, and I found it easy to switch between the various modes. I rarely relied on the throttle alone because the assist provided plenty of oomph. The bike has a payload capacity of 275 pounds and reaches a top speed of 28 miles per hour. The Groove has 50 miles of range; however, there is a dual-battery option that pops it up to 100 miles.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">One note, though: Wow, this bike is hefty. And while that is generally a good thing, folks should give themselves a bit of time to adjust to its weight.&#160;</p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">I also tested <a href="https://mod-bikes.com/pages/mod-connect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mod Connect</a>, which allows users to wirelessly pair a Lumos ultra-smart helmet to sync and control turn signals directly from the bike. The connected bike helmet made me feel far more visible to drivers as I navigated the busy streets of downtown Austin.<br></p>

<p class="wp-block-paragraph">What is &#8220;This week&#8217;s wheels&#8221;? It&#8217;s a chance to learn about the different transportation products we&#8217;re testing, whether it&#8217;s an electric or hybrid car, an e-bike, or even a ride in an autonomous vehicle.&#160;</p>

## Article: Facebook hired ‘ex-police captain’ in India for potential imprisonment, new book claims

**Published:** Today at 11:23 PM
**Description:** At a time when Facebook was having trouble with law enforcement and government authorities outside the U.S., the company hired an ‘ex-police captain’ in India to go to jail on the company’s behalf in case of a clash between the company and the government, a new book alleges

### Content

<div><p>Social media and communications giant Meta hired an &#8220;ex-police captain&#8221; in India to undergo arrest in case executives were targeted in government raids. The claim has been made by Sarah Wynn-Williams in a newly released memoir, <i>Careless People</i>, the publication of which the Facebook and WhatsApp parent is seeking to thwart. Ms. Wynn-Williams was global director of public policy at Meta until eight years ago, and has also served as a diplomat for New Zealand.&#160;</p><p>Through an arbitration hearing in the U.S., <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/meta-wins-halt-to-promotion-of-careless-people-tell-all-book-by-former-employee/article69324472.ece" target="_self">Meta has stopped Ms. Wynn-Williams from promoting the book</a>, and is seeking to stop its publication. However, the book remains on sale in India. </p><p>&#8220;This book is a mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims about the company and false accusations about our executives,&#8221; a Meta spokesperson told<i> The Hindu</i>, without providing specific responses to India-related claims in the book. &#8220;Eight years ago, Sarah Wynn-Williams was fired for poor performance and toxic behaviour, and an investigation at the time determined she made misleading and unfounded allegations of harassment. Since then, she has been paid by anti-Facebook activists and this is simply a continuation of that work.&#8221;</p><p>While much of the book is dedicated to the alleged behaviour of Meta executives, including chief executive officer and founder Mark Zuckerberg, there are details of the firm&#8217;s operations around the world that the company has not specifically contested.</p><h4 class="sub_head">&#8216;Ex-police captain&#8217;</h4><p>Ms. Wynn-Williams, who says she had often travelled to India for work at Meta, was describing clashes and friction with governments in South Korea, Brazil and India.&#160;</p><p>Specifically on India, she writes: &#8220;In India the situation&#8217;s so bad, Facebook&#8217;s leadership hires an ex&#8211;police captain who&#8217;s been given some boring, official-sounding title but is understood by the policy team to be someone who &#8220;would be able to handle an arrest situation well &#8212; that is, go to jail in a clash between Facebook and the Indian government.&#8221; The company was not yet renamed to Meta at this point.</p><h4 class="sub_head">Free Basics</h4><p>Ms. Wynn-Williams also made claims on discussions within the company around the time Facebook (then not rebranded as Meta) had launched Free Basics, a programme to provide limited access to some websites to low-income users that was later effectively prohibited in India for being a violation of Net Neutrality, the concept that all traffic on the Internet should be treated equally by Internet providers.&#160;</p><p>&#8220;The government&#8217;s Telecom Regulatory Authority (TRAI) started to flex its significant power and announced it was going to look into programs like Internet.org [Free Basics&#8217;s previous name] and get the public to weigh in on whether they should be banned,&#8221; the author writes. &#8220;Our policy team is directly engaged with the government, include [sic] Prime Minister Modi&#8217;s office,&#8221; she quoted an email by then chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg as saying. &#8220;We&#8217;re lucky this is happening in a place where we have very deep senior relationships in the government, but it&#8217;s still going to be hard. If we lose this in India it will send all the wrong signals in Latin America.&#8221;</p><p>An internal action plan document described a strategy to &#8220;galvanize actual (<i>or at least the appearance of</i>) public support,&#8221; she wrote. (Italics in the original document, per the author.) The company urged users to send automated emails around this time urging TRAI to protect Free Basics, a strategy that annoyed TRAI officials because the emails were in the millions, and did not answer questions in the consultation paper published by TRAI.</p><p>&#8220;Mark writes to Prime Minister Modi trying to arrange a meeting,&#8221; Ms. Wynn-Williams recalled, referring to Mr. Zuckerberg. &#8220;Sheryl calls the minister in charge of the internet; Joel and the India team organize outreach to other politicians. There&#8217;s lots of travel back and forth to India.&#8221;</p><p>On January 7, 2016, Ms. Wynn-Williams wrote, Facebook was able to nudge users to send around 16 million emails by leveraging pop-ups sent to Indian users en masse &#8212; turning on a &#8220;megaphone that Mark wouldn&#8217;t let Sheryl use for [promoting] organ donation&#8221;. But she says, an initial count of comments only counted 1.4 million comments, sending executives into a panic.</p><p>&#8220;A few days later, a breakthrough. The team figures out what happened. Someone at TRAI&#8212;whoever controlled the email address for the public comments &#8212; simply opted out of all emails from Facebook.&#8221; In the end, Ms. Wynn-Williams wrote, &#8220;Mark and some of the brightest tech minds in the world devoted months to this [outreach strategy], and some low-ranking official in India outfoxed them simply by clicking an opt-out box.&#8221;&#160;</p><p class="articleblock-container" id="arthardpv"></p><p class="spliter pt-0 mb-0 print-hide"></p><p class="ad-text" id="artproduct2"></p><p class="d-none d-lg-block d-xl-block"></p><p class="d-block d-sm-none "></p></div>

Instead, it appears to be intended for partner companies tasked with mapping assignments.</p><p>Upon downloading the app, users are prompted to "Open Partner App," which redirects them to another application called Premise.</p><p>Premise, a third-party platform, allows users to earn rewards by completing various tasks, including surveys, reporting local details like construction updates, and photographing specific locations.</p><p>Based on app strings found in Surveyor, it appears that once a mapping task is assigned via Premise, users will be instructed to mount an iPhone, switch it to landscape mode, and capture images along a designated route while driving.</p><p>According to Apple, the Surveyor app captures data on road infrastructure and transmits it to Apple, where it helps "precisely place objects on the map.</p><p>"This approach suggests that Apple is leveraging crowdsourced data collection to refine its mapping system and keep small but crucial map details current.</p><p>While Premise is not officially listed as an Apple Maps partner, the integration of the two apps indicates a collaboration for continuous Apple Maps updates.</p><p>With this move, Apple seems to be embracing community-driven data collection to strengthen its mapping ecosystem, potentially rivaling similar strategies used by Google Maps and Waze.</p><p>As Apple continues to refine Apple Maps, the Surveyor app may represent a broader push toward AI-driven, real-time map enhancements, ensuring users receive more accurate and detailed navigation assistance. </p><p class="articleblock-container" id="arthardpv"></p><p class="spliter pt-0 mb-0 print-hide"></p><p class="ad-text" id="artproduct2"></p><p class="d-none d-lg-block d-xl-block"></p><p class="d-block d-sm-none "></p></div>

<div><p>Tens of thousands of<a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/jpmorgan-launches-in-house-chatbot-as-ai-based-research-analyst/article68449846.ece" target="_self"> JPMorgan Chase software engineers increased their productivity 10% to 20% by using a coding assistant tool developed by the bank,</a> its global chief information officer Lori Beer said.</p><p>The gains present "a great opportunity" for the lender to assign its engineers to other projects, Beer told Reuters ahead of DevUp, an internal conference hosted by JPMorgan, bringing together its top engineers in India this year.</p><p>The largest lender in the U.S. had a technology budget of $17 billion for 2024. Its tech workforce of 63,000 employees, with a third of them based in India, represents about 21% of its global headcount.</p><p>The efficiency gains from the coding assistant will also allow JPMorgan's engineers to devote more time to high-value projects focusing on artificial intelligence and data, Beer said.</p><p>The bank already has about 450 potential cases for which it could use AI, and CEO Jamie Dimon expects those potential applications to surge to 1,000 by next year. The bank is focused on areas where it can use AI to make money for its businesses, Beer said.</p><p>"I wouldn't say success is if we get 1,000 done," she said. "Success is if we continue to articulate that it's not just an incremental shift with AI, but we're transforming and creating value," she said.</p><p>JPMorgan's president Daniel Pinto previously said implementing AI could add about $1 billion to $1.5 billion in value for the bank.</p><p>In terms of hiring, "we've sort of passed our high growth time", Beer said.</p><p>"There's so much productivity and opportunity as we think about a world with AI. We've grown rapidly... You're going to see us continue to optimize the footprint we have," she said.</p><p>In 2022, Beer said the company planned to hire about 2,000 engineers worldwide. </p><p class="articleblock-container" id="arthardpv"></p><p class="spliter pt-0 mb-0 print-hide"></p><p class="ad-text" id="artproduct2"></p><p class="d-none d-lg-block d-xl-block"></p><p class="d-block d-sm-none "></p></div>

<div><p>]</p><p>A London court hearing, reported to be Apple's appeal against a British government order to create a "back door" to its encrypted cloud storage systems, was held in secret on Friday, with media not allowed to attend despite a formal request.</p><p>In February, The Washington Post reported that Britain had issued a "technical capability notice" to the tech firm to enable access to encrypted messages and photos, even for users outside the country.</p><p>The iPhone maker in response removed its most advanced security encryption for cloud data, called Advanced Data Protection, for new users in Britain.</p><p>Details of the case have been shrouded in secrecy, and <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/trump-compares-uks-demand-for-apple-user-data-to-chinese-monitoring/article69284258.ece" target="_self">neither Apple nor the British government has publicly confirmed the technical capability notice.</a></p><p>The BBC reported a hearing on Friday simply listed as "an application in private" at the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, a court that considers allegations of unlawful intrusion by public bodies, was Apple's appeal against this order.</p><p>There was no confirmation of what parties were involved, although James Eadie, who represents the government in its most serious legal cases, attended. He declined to comment. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>A lawyer representing 10 media organisations, including Reuters and the BBC, submitted an application to the tribunal for the case to be held in public.</p><p>The court confirmed receipt of his email but he was not invited to appear before the judges to make any further submissions on Friday, and no reporters were allowed in the courtroom. The hearing concluded after about six hours.</p><p>Two civil rights groups, Privacy International and Liberty, have also challenged the secrecy of the case and the issuing of the technical capability notice itself. Caroline Wilson Palow, Legal Director at Privacy International, said it was "unacceptable and disproportionate".</p><p>"People the world over rely on end-to-end encryption to protect themselves from harassment and oppression," she said. "No country should have the power to undermine that protection for everyone."</p><p>Governments and tech giants have long been locked in a battle over strong encryption to protect consumers' communications, which the authorities believe can be an obstacle to investigations into crimes from terrorism to child sex offences.</p><p>But Britain's demands are seen as particularly sweeping.</p><p>"We told them you can't do this," U.S. President Donald Trump told the Spectator magazine in an interview last month about the British demand. "That's something ... that you hear about in China."</p><p>U.S. officials are also investigating whether Britain violated a bilateral pact by pressuring Apple as the move could breach the CLOUD Act, which bars Britain from issuing demands for the data of U.S. citizens and vice versa.</p><p>Britain's Home Office (interior ministry) has declined to comment on the case, and Security Minister Dan Jarvis told parliament last month the government operated a policy of neither confirming nor denying the existence of TCNs.</p><p>"What I can say is that the suggestion that privacy and security are at odds is not correct; we can and must have both," he said.</p><p class="articleblock-container" id="arthardpv"></p><p class="spliter pt-0 mb-0 print-hide"></p><p class="ad-text" id="artproduct2"></p><p class="d-none d-lg-block d-xl-block"></p><p class="d-block d-sm-none "></p></div>

## Article: Court blocks California law on children's online safety

**Description:** A federal judge said California cannot enforce a state law meant to shield children from harmful online content

### Content

<div><p>A federal judge said California <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/judge-blocks-california-law-meant-to-protect-childrens-online-safety/article67321537.ece" target="_self">cannot enforce a state law meant to shield children from online content that could harm them mentally or physically.</a></p><p>U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman ruled on Thursday that the trade group NetChoice deserved a preliminary injunction because it was likely to show the California Age-Appropriate Design Code Act violated its members' free speech rights under the Constitution's First Amendment.</p><p>NetChoice said the law would turn its 39 members, including Amazon.com, Google, Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms, Netflix and Elon Musk's X, into state-deputised censors and "censor the internet under the guise of privacy."</p><p>The office of California Attorney General Rob Bonta expressed disappointment on Friday, and said he "remains committed to tackling this issue and to defending California's common-sense statutes." It plans to respond to the decision in court.</p><p>Ambika Kumar, a lawyer for NetChoice, called the law "a breathtaking act of unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, content-based censorship. We are pleased to see it enjoined."</p><p>Signed by Governor Gavin Newsom in September 2022, California's law required businesses to create reports addressing whether their online platforms could harm children, and take steps before launch to reduce the risks.</p><p>It also required businesses to estimate ages of child users and configure privacy settings for them, or provide high settings for everyone. Civil fines could reach $2,500 per child for negligence and $7,500 per child for intentional violations.</p><p>In her 56-page decision, Freeman said the law imposed significant burdens and was not narrowly tailored to advance California's alleged compelling interest in protecting children from bullying, harassment, sexual exploitation, sleep loss and other harms.</p><p>"A regulation that focuses on the emotive impact of speech on its audience is content-based, and therefore must be drawn as narrowly as possible," the San Jose, California, judge wrote. "The state has not shown that the (law) is narrowly drawn here."</p><p>Freeman also enjoined the law in September 2023. A federal appeals court set aside part of her injunction last August and ordered a reassessment. The law was supposed to take effect last July.</p><p>The case is NetChoice LLC et al v Bonta, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 22-08861.</p><p class="articleblock-container" id="arthardpv"></p><p class="spliter pt-0 mb-0 print-hide"></p><p class="ad-text" id="artproduct2"></p><p class="d-none d-lg-block d-xl-block"></p><p class="d-block d-sm-none "></p></div>
